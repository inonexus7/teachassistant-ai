**Teachassist** is a free landing page template built on top of Material UI and fully coded in **Next.js** and **Python**.
Simple & light is designed to provide all the basic components using the `sx` prop for a developer need to create landing page for Online Course product.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## How to use it

- Run `npm run dev` in root folder
- Run `python app.py` in backend folder
- Run `stripe login --interactive` and then `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:your_port/your_urlpattern`

**Remember**
You'd better run this backend in virtual environment of python (in this case, venv folder).
And you don't need to run stripe cli if it is running on domain.

## Deploy on Vercel
